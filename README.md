<h2>Overview</h2>
<b>This healthcare analytics project aims to address important challenges and opportunities within our healthcare system through data analysis. We aim to understand and improve how efficiently we schedule appointments, increase patient satisfaction, allocate resources better based on changing demand, evaluate how administrative tasks affect patient experiences, assess the effectiveness of our referral system, and gain insights into the diverse healthcare needs across different groups of people. Additionally, there is a need for an interactive dashboard to visualize and communicate the findings effectively. Through careful data analysis and the development of an interactive dashboard, our goal is to make informed decisions and improve the quality of care for our patients.</b>b>


<h2>Business Problems</h2>

<b>Here are the aspects I covered in my analysis:</b>
- <b>Average Wait Time: Identified typical wait times for patient appointments to assess the efficiency of our scheduling processes and identify areas for improvement.</b>
- <b>Patient Satisfaction: Helped with understanding the factors influencing patient satisfaction is crucial for enhancing the overall patient experience and improving the quality of care we provide. </b>
- <b>Total Patient Visits Monthly: Analyzed the monthly patient visit volume helps us understand the demand for healthcare services over time, enabling better resource allocation and capacity planning.</b>
- <b>Administrative vs. Non-Administrative Appointments: Distinguished between different appointment types allows us to evaluate the impact of administrative processes on wait times and patient satisfaction.</b>
- <b>Referrals and Walk-In Patients: Examinined the balance between referred and walk-in patients provides insights into the referral system's effectiveness and its implications for the patient experience.</b>
- <b>Patient Visits by Age Group and Race: Analyzed patient visits by age group and race helps us understand the diversity of healthcare needs and preferences among different demographic segments, informing tailored healthcare strategies and interventions.</b>


<h2>Key Findings</h2>

- <b>AEMR documented a total of 4,655 outages in the year 2016 to 2017, out of which 4,102 were approved outages, resulting in an overall energy loss of 156,211 MW, with 124,448 MW attributed to approved outages.</b>
- <b>During this period, there was a notable increase in energy loss by approximately 5% and a rise in outage events by around 17%. However, approved outages saw a significant increase of 12%. </b>
- <b>Forced outages accounted for the majority, constituting 70% of all outage types, with a substantial increase of 28% from 2016 to 2017. Conversely, Opportunistic Maintenance recorded the lowest number of 
     outage events.</b>
- <b>Upon further analysis of outage durations, Scheduled outages were found to have the longest duration, lasting approximately 5 days. While Forced outages had a shorter duration of 0.6 days, their unplanned 
     nature and frequency pose significant risks to network performance and reliability, leading to increased energy loss.</b>
- <b>Among energy providers and facilities, AURICON, GW, and MELK, along with their respective facilities AURICON_PNJ_U1, BW1_GREENWATER, and MELK_G7, emerged as the top three unreliable entities due to their 
     high recorded outage events, primarily forced outages, and energy loss during the 2016/2017 period.</b>
- <b>Among energy providers and facilities, AURICON, GW, and MELK, along with their respective facilities AURICON_PNJ_U1, BW1_GREENWATER, and MELK_G7, emerged as the top three unreliable entities due to their 
     high recorded outage events, primarily forced outages, and energy loss during the 2016/2017 period.</b>
- <b>Additionally, an analysis of complaints descriptions associated with the recorded outages identified the top three issues and their corresponding facilities: Operational issues causing real-time forced outage (BW1_GREENWATER facility), FO (PJRH_GT11 facility), TES Report_constrained off MW's (PEATHENENERGY_KOR facility) and Deviation from dispatch (TIWEST_COG1 facility).

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

- <b>Implement Strategies to Reduce Forced Outages:
Develop proactive maintenance plans to address equipment reliability issues and minimize forced outages.
Enhance monitoring systems to detect potential failures early and prevent unplanned downtime.
Invest in workforce training to ensure efficient response and resolution of forced outage incidents.</b>
- <b> Optimize Scheduled Outages:
Review and streamline scheduled maintenance processes to minimize downtime while ensuring effective performance and reliability.
Coordinate scheduled outages more effectively to reduce their duration and minimize their impact on energy loss.</b>
- <b>Prioritize Investments in Reliable Energy Providers and Facilities:
Conduct thorough assessments of energy providers and facilities to identify areas for improvement and prioritize investments in enhancing reliability.
Collaborate with unreliable providers to address underlying issues and improve outage management practices.</b>
- <b>Address Operational Issues Promptly:
Establish protocols for addressing operational issues that lead to real-time forced outages, focusing on rapid response and resolution to minimize disruptions.
Strengthen communication and collaboration among relevant stakeholders to ensure effective coordination in managing operational issues.</b>
- <b>Continuously Monitor and Evaluate Performance:
Establish performance metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor the effectiveness of outage management initiatives.
Conduct regular performance reviews and evaluations to identify areas for improvement and make necessary adjustments to outage management strategies.</b>
