<h2>Overview</h2>
The American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR) oversees the stability, reliability, and continuity of the domestic energy network in the United States, aiming to minimize disruptions and outages. However, the AEMR currently penalizes only forced outages among the four types (consequential, opportunistic, forced, planned) due to their potential to exceed energy supply, impacting network reliability and stability.


<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
What strategies can be implemented to decrease energy loss by approximately 5% and reduce outage events by around 17% at AEMR, thereby enhancing energy stability and market reliability for the 2016/2017 period?



<h2>Key Findings</h2>

- <b>AEMR documented a total of 4,655 outages in the year 2016 to 2017, out of which 4,102 were approved outages, resulting in an overall energy loss of 156,211 MW, with 124,448 MW attributed to approved outages.</b>
- <b>During this period, there was a notable increase in energy loss by approximately 5% and a rise in outage events by around 17%. However, approved outages saw a significant increase of 12%. </b>
- <b>Forced outages accounted for the majority, constituting 70% of all outage types, with a substantial increase of 28% from 2016 to 2017. Conversely, Opportunistic Maintenance recorded the lowest number of 
     outage events.</b>
- <b>Upon further analysis of outage durations, Scheduled outages were found to have the longest duration, lasting approximately 5 days. While Forced outages had a shorter duration of 0.6 days, their unplanned 
     nature and frequency pose significant risks to network performance and reliability, leading to increased energy loss.</b>
- <b>Among energy providers and facilities, AURICON, GW, and MELK, along with their respective facilities AURICON_PNJ_U1, BW1_GREENWATER, and MELK_G7, emerged as the top three unreliable entities due to their 
     high recorded outage events, primarily forced outages, and energy loss during the 2016/2017 period.</b>
- <b>Among energy providers and facilities, AURICON, GW, and MELK, along with their respective facilities AURICON_PNJ_U1, BW1_GREENWATER, and MELK_G7, emerged as the top three unreliable entities due to their 
     high recorded outage events, primarily forced outages, and energy loss during the 2016/2017 period.</b>
- <b>Additionally, an analysis of complaints descriptions associated with the recorded outages identified the top three issues and their corresponding facilities: Operational issues causing real-time forced outage (BW1_GREENWATER facility), FO (PJRH_GT11 facility), TES Report_constrained off MW's (PEATHENENERGY_KOR facility) and Deviation from dispatch (TIWEST_COG1 facility).

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

- <b>Implement Strategies to Reduce Forced Outages:
Develop proactive maintenance plans to address equipment reliability issues and minimize forced outages.
Enhance monitoring systems to detect potential failures early and prevent unplanned downtime.
Invest in workforce training to ensure efficient response and resolution of forced outage incidents.</b>
- <b> Optimize Scheduled Outages:
Review and streamline scheduled maintenance processes to minimize downtime while ensuring effective performance and reliability.
Coordinate scheduled outages more effectively to reduce their duration and minimize their impact on energy loss.</b>
- <b>Prioritize Investments in Reliable Energy Providers and Facilities:
Conduct thorough assessments of energy providers and facilities to identify areas for improvement and prioritize investments in enhancing reliability.
Collaborate with unreliable providers to address underlying issues and improve outage management practices.</b>
- <b>Address Operational Issues Promptly:
Establish protocols for addressing operational issues that lead to real-time forced outages, focusing on rapid response and resolution to minimize disruptions.
Strengthen communication and collaboration among relevant stakeholders to ensure effective coordination in managing operational issues.</b>
- <b>Continuously Monitor and Evaluate Performance:
Establish performance metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor the effectiveness of outage management initiatives.
Conduct regular performance reviews and evaluations to identify areas for improvement and make necessary adjustments to outage management strategies.</b>
